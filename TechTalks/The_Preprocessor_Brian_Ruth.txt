> C/C++ Preprocessor works on directives, directives can be any of the following:
    Include             - #include
    Error               - #error
    Compiler Extentions - #pragma, _Pragma 
    Replace             - #define, #undef, #, ##
    File or Line info   - #line
    Conditional         - #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif, #endif etc.
> Modules is a new directive in C++ 23

> The #define <identifier> <replacement>, the <identifier> MUST be unique to this
    Translation Unit.
> Directives do NOT have Scope

> The preprocessor copies the whole "#include" into the .c file. This becomes one
    translation unit.
