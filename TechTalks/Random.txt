=>  Python's motivation was that I wanted something between Shell Scripting and C

=>  One language is never sufficient for all tasks, for obvious reasons. Some codebases
    might have a certain language and you need to code in that for features or bugs.
    Some programming languages are just better suited to certain tasks. If you need 
    to use a new Language should be selected based on the task at hand. Just like
    Data Structures and Algorithms should be catered to the data they need to operate
    on. Because if there is a project to be done, the choice of programming language
    is dependent on a lot of factors. The time it takes to program in that language,
    the maintainaibility aspect, how useful the libraries are, speed vs memory tradeoffs
    etc. Choose wisely! Do not program a web page in C language, it can be done but
    you cannot attract a huge community, also the boilerplate will drive you mad!
